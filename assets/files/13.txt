Common Name: Blueberries
Scientific Name: Vaccinium spp. (e.g., Vaccinium corymbosum)
Family: Ericaceae

Cultivation: Full sun to partial shade, acidic, well-draining soil with plenty of organic matter. Regular watering, especially during dry periods.

Propagation: Blueberries are typically propagated by stem cuttings or layering.

Planting: Plant blueberry bushes in early spring or fall, spaced 4-6 feet apart in rows or containers.

Care: Mulch around the base of the plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds. Prune in late winter to remove dead or damaged branches and improve air circulation.

Harvesting: Blueberries are typically ready for harvest in mid to late summer. Pick ripe berries when they have turned fully blue and easily detach from the bush.
