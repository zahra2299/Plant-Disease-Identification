Common Name: Cherry
Scientific Name: Prunus avium (Sweet Cherry), Prunus cerasus (Sour Cherry)
Family: Rosaceae
Cultivation: Full sun, well-drained soil with good air circulation. Sweet cherries prefer slightly alkaline soil, while sour cherries tolerate acidic soil.

Propagation: Typically propagated by grafting onto rootstocks, but can also be grown from seeds or cuttings.

Planting: Plant bare-root cherry trees in late winter to early spring, or container-grown trees in spring or fall. Space trees 20-25 feet apart.

Care: Water newly planted trees regularly, deep watering during dry spells. Mulch around the base of the tree to conserve moisture and suppress weeds.

Pruning: Prune cherry trees in late winter to early spring to remove dead, damaged, or crossing branches. Sour cherry trees benefit from open center or vase-shaped pruning, while sweet cherry trees are pruned to a modified central leader.

Harvesting: Sweet cherries are typically harvested in late spring to early summer, while sour cherries are harvested in mid to late summer. Pick cherries when fully ripe but firm, as they do not continue to ripen after picking.
