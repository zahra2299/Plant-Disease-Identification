Common Name: Raspberries
Scientific Name: Rubus spp. (e.g., Rubus idaeus)
Family: Rosaceae

Cultivation: Full sun to partial shade, well-drained soil rich in organic matter. Regular watering, especially during fruiting season.

Propagation: Raspberries are commonly propagated by division, root cuttings, or tip layering.

Planting: Plant raspberry canes in early spring or fall, spaced 2-3 feet apart in rows or raised beds.

Care: Provide support for raspberry canes with trellises or stakes. Prune canes annually after fruiting to remove spent canes and encourage new growth.

Harvesting: Raspberries are typically ready for harvest in mid to late summer. Pick ripe berries when they easily detach from the stem and have a deep color.
