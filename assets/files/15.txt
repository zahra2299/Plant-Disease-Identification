Common Name: Aloe Vera
Scientific Name: Aloe barbadensis miller
Family: Asphodelaceae

Cultivation: Bright, indirect sunlight, well-draining soil. Allow soil to dry out between waterings, as Aloe Vera is drought-tolerant.

Propagation: Aloe Vera can be propagated by division of offsets or from seeds.

Planting: Plant Aloe Vera in containers with drainage holes, using a well-draining potting mix.

Care: Avoid overwatering, as Aloe Vera is susceptible to root rot in waterlogged soil. Fertilize sparingly, as too much fertilizer can damage the plant.

Harvesting: Harvest Aloe Vera leaves as needed by cutting them close to the base of the plant. The gel inside the leaves can be used for various medicinal and skincare purposes.
